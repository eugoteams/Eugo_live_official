According to the last census, nearly 6 million people work in the Paris metropolitan area; many of whom are international employees working for multinational companies based in the city. Working for a non-French company in Paris can be the best way to get a job in the city for a non-Parisian. Otherwise, finding a position can be fairly difficult. Despite the fact that Paris is home to a wide range of businesses, and nearly 20 Fortune Global 500 companies are headquartered there, there can still be some hurdles finding a job in the stagnant French economy. For the determined, however, it's possible.

So how do you get started? This guide will walk you through 8 steps you need to follow to give yourself the best chance of landing a job in Paris.

### [](https://wise.com/us/blog/finding-a-job-in-paris#1-learn-french)1. Learn French

Well, at least some French. While in many European cities it’s possible to live and work without speaking a word of the local language, the case isn't the same in Paris. French companies usually look for individuals who have firm grasp of the language, and even finding a job in a pub can be impossible without some French speaking skills.

So how do you get started? It’s easy enough to lock down the basics with smartphone apps like Duolingo, Memrise, Babbel and Busuu. If you’re already an intermediate French speaker, it’s worth taking formal classes or getting a private tutor to get your language skills up to speed. Finding an online tutor is easy with sites like [italki](https://www.italki.com/home), [Skype Language](http://skype-language.com/en/teachers), [Live Lingua](https://www.livelingua.com/), or [Tutor.com](http://www.tutor.com/subjects/foreign-languages).

In English, the word résumé translates roughly to “summary”. In many places in the world, CVs and résumés have become largely interchangeable, wherein both the short-form resume and the long-form curriculum vitae aren't restricted by length; either can be 1, 5, 10, or however many pages you need.

In Paris, however, résumé should still be viewed in the traditional sense: a summary, no longer than a single page for junior positions, or two pages maximum for senior positions. Longer résumés are often thrown out without so much as a glance. Make sure you're concise, avoid buzzwords, and only list your most relevant experience for the position.

It’s also fairly common in France to include your picture at the top of your résumé document. However, if you don’t have a professional photo of yourself, it’s ok to not include one. Having no picture will serve you better than a selfie or a shot of you from vacation or at the bar.

Lastly, and very importantly, check your spelling. Every time you reference the document, make sure to use the correct French grammar with l’accent grave in place above both E’s in résumé.
