## WE OFFER TWO KINDS OF JOBS IN PARIS: BABYSITTING & TEACHING  

We offer two types of positions in Paris :

Our babysitting jobs consist of looking after children, aged 3 to 12, usually after school, from 4:30 PM to 7.30PM. Your involvement in helping them learn a new language will be colossal, as you are expected to discuss, play, sing and make fun activities with them.

 

A number of material resources, developed by specialists in language learning, are provided to help you interact and connect with kids.​

 

Our **[teachers](https://www.momji.fr/jobs/en/teaching-jobs-france)** have the objective to help children, students or professionals learn a new language, in a flexible environment, according to each person’s needs. With your past experience, you should be able to play and have fun with younger audiences, while run fairly structured lessons for adults.

 

All we ask from you is:

*  Be over 18
*  Have some experience in babysitting or teaching (formal or informal)
*  Have a European Community citizenship or a visa that allows you to work in France​

 

 

**NO FRENCH NEEDED**

Another great reason for English-speakers to work with Mômji is that no French is needed! 

All babysitting and teaching activities take place in English, so do not fear if you are yet to master the French language. In fact, in many families it is best that the child's only option to communicate with you is in English!

 

Please note that we do not require any specific degree or qualification, and you do not even have to speak French at all.​
